This project aims to answer the question: Can we predict what position college football prospects will be drafted based on what school they went to, what position they play, their combine stats, and other parameters? This project was an assignment for the UCSB course "Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning" which uses machine learning techniques to develop a categorical model.
